# Linked Lists
A linked list is a data structure comprised of objects which contain data and pointers to other nodes, they are ideal for sequential data accessing but poor for random access


## Linked List Generator
Generates multiple types of linked list and displays their contents and relationships in a graph form 

Ultimately will generate the following types of linked list

Singly linked list: a one way relationship of nodes with a single pointer to the following node 

Doubly linked list: a two way relationship of nodes with pointers to both the previous and proceeding node

Adjacency linked list: one to many relationship of nodes where a node can point from 1 to indefinite nodes

## Linked List Editor
A future development module for interacting with generated linked lists, will contain the following functionality

Search Nodes

Append Node

Prepend Node

Add Node to Specific Location

Delete Node

Pop Node

Delete Head Node


## Linked List GUI

Possible later project to throw together a quick gui
